Overview
This project analyzes a loan approval dataset to identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions. The goal is to develop insights into how demographics, income, credit history, and loan amount impact loan approvals, and to build a predictive model to assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions.


Objectives
1.	Handle Missing Data: Identify and treat missing values using appropriate imputation or removal techniques.
2.	Demographic Analysis: Study the effect of gender, marital status, dependents, education, and employment status on loan approval.
3.	Income & Loan Amount Analysis: Explore the relationship between applicant/co-applicant income, loan amount, and loan approval likelihood.
4.	Credit & Loan Term Analysis: Assess how credit history and loan term affect loan approval.
5.	Property Area Analysis: Investigate how the location of the property influences loan approvals.

   
Dataset
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
•	Applicant Income & Co-applicant Income
•	Loan Amount & Loan Term
•	Credit History
•	Demographic Information (Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Employment Status)
•	Property Location (Urban, Semi-urban, Rural)
•	Loan Approval Status

Project Workflow
•	Data Exploration
	Load and inspect the dataset.                                                                                              The Loan Approval was loaded from a CSV file using pandas. Libraries like NumPy and warning were imported for numerical operations and handling warnings, respectively. Identify and visualize missing values.
	Perform descriptive statistics on numerical features.
Descriptive Statistics numerical features were explored using
df.descibe()
	Identify and visualize missing values by were explored by using df.isnull().sum()

•	Handling Missing Data:
1.	Implement strategies like mean/median imputation for numerical values.
2.	Use mode imputation for categorical values.
3.	Remove records with excessive missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Loan Approval Dataset
•	Dataset Overview: Contains applicant demographics, financial details, credit history, and loan-related attributes.
•	Key Factor – Credit History: Applicants with a positive credit history have significantly higher loan approval rates.
•	Income & Loan Amount Relationship: Moderate correlation observed; higher income often leads to larger loan approvals.
•	Demographic Impact: Marital status, education, and property area influence approval rates, with graduates and married applicants having better chances.
•	Outliers & Distribution: Box plots reveal income and loan amount outliers, while histograms show skewed distributions.
•	Visualization Insights: Bar charts, correlation heatmaps, and stacked plots help in identifying approval trends across different applicant groups.

Analysis         
Demographic Analysis (Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed )     
	Relationship Between Loan Approval and Gender:
 Used pd.crosstab() to analyze loan approval rates across gender categories. The result shows that male applicants (278 approvals) had a higher loan approval count compared to female applicants (54 approvals), likely due to differences in income or financial stability.
   
	Relationship Between Loan Approval and Marital Status:   
Used pd.crosstab() to analyze how marital status affects loan approval. The results indicate that married applicants (227 approvals, ~73%) had a higher loan approval rate compared to unmarried applicants (105 approvals, ~62%), suggesting that marital status may contribute to financial stability and loan eligibility.

	Influence of Dependents on Loan Approval:
Used seaborn.boxenplot() to visualize how the number of dependents affects loan approval. The plot helps identify trends and variations in dependents across approved (Yes) and rejected (No) loans, highlighting whether having more dependents impacts approval rates.

	Loan Approval by Education Background:
 Used pd.crosstab() to analyze loan approval rates for Graduates vs. Non-Graduates. The results show that graduates (271 approvals, ~71%) had a higher approval rate than non-graduates (61 approvals, ~63%), indicating that education level may influence loan approval. Additionally, a bar chart (plt.bar()) was used to visualize the approval rates, making the comparison clearer.

	Impact of Self-Employment on Loan Approval:
 Used df.groupby().size().unstack() to analyze loan approval rates for self-employed vs. non-self-employed applicants. The results show that non-self-employed applicants (289 approvals, ~70%) had a higher approval rate than self-employed applicants (43 approvals, ~65%), indicating that self-employment status might pose a challenge in securing loans. Additionally, a bar chart (plt.bar()) was used to visualize approval rates for better comparison.
         
Income and Loan Amount Analysis (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome vs LoanAmount)
	Relationship Between Applicant Income and Loan Approval:
 Used seaborn.boxplot() to visualize the distribution of ApplicantIncome across approved (Yes) and rejected (No) loan applications. 

	Influence of Co-Applicant Income on Loan Approval:
Used plt.pie() to visualize the proportion of loan approvals based on Co-Applicant Income categories. The pie chart helps illustrate whether having a co-applicant impacts loan approval rates, providing insights into financial stability considerations in the approval process.

	Correlation Analysis Between Applicant Income, Co-Applicant Income, and Loan Amount:
Created a scatter plot using plt.scatter() to visualize the relationship between TotalIncome (ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome) and LoanAmount. This helps identify whether higher total income correlates with higher loan amounts, providing insights into lending patterns.

	Comparison of Loan Amounts Across Demographic Groups: 
Used subplots with bar plots, strip plots, and violin plots to compare loan amounts requested by different demographic groups.

Credit History and Loan Term Analysis (Effect of Credit History & Loan_Amount_Term on Loan Approval)
	Relationship Between Loan Term and Loan Approval Rate: Used pd.crosstab() to analyze how different Loan_Amount_Term durations affect loan approval. The results indicate that 36-month terms are the most common, with 292 approvals but also 121 rejections, suggesting a balanced approval rate. Shorter terms (6, 12 months) had 100% approval, while mid-range terms (18, 30, 48 months) saw more rejections. A strip plot (sb.stripplot()) was used to visualize the distribution of loan terms across approval statuses.
     
Property Area and Loan Approval (Loan Approval rates across Urban, Semiurban, and Rural areas)
	Interaction Between Credit History and Loan Term:
Used pd.crosstab() to analyze how Loan_Amount_Term and Credit_History interact. The results indicate that applicants with a positive credit history (1.0) have significantly higher loan approvals across all loan terms, especially for 36-month terms (359 approvals). Conversely, applicants with no/poor credit history (0.0) struggle to get approved, with notable loan term distributions in the 18-month (10 applicants) and 36-month (54 applicants) categories.

	Impact of Property Area on Loan Amounts Requested:
 Used seaborn.pointplot() to analyze how Property_Area (Urban, Semiurban, Rural) influences LoanAmount. The visualization shows that urban applicants tend to request higher loan amounts, while rural applicants generally request lower amounts. This trend suggests that property value and living costs in different areas affect loan amount requests.

Conclusion – Loan Approval Analysis Report
•	Credit History is the Key Factor – Applicants with positive credit history (1.0) have significantly higher approval rates.
•	Income & Loan Amount Relationship – Higher applicant income generally correlates with larger loan approvals.
•	Demographics Impact Approval – Married applicants, graduates, and fewer dependents have better approval chances.
•	Self-Employment Challenges – Self-employed applicants face slightly lower approval rates due to income stability concerns.
•	Loan Term Trends – 36-month terms are the most common, but shorter terms (6-12 months) have higher approval rates.
•	Property Area Influence – Urban applicants request higher loan amounts compared to semiurban and rural applicants.
•	Visual Insights – Box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots helped uncover patterns in loan approval trends.
•	Business Impact – Insights can help lenders refine risk assessment and improve loan approval policies.
